# REVENG Web Interface Status

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental Status

The REVENG Web Interface is currently in **EXPERIMENTAL** status. This means:

- ‚úÖ **Core functionality works** - File upload, analysis, and basic results display
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not production-ready** - May have bugs, performance issues, or missing features
- üîÑ **Under active development** - Features and APIs may change
- üß™ **Testing recommended** - Use for evaluation and testing purposes

## üöß Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Performance Issues**
   - Large file uploads (>50MB) may timeout
   - Analysis progress tracking may be inaccurate for very large binaries
   - Memory usage can be high during analysis

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - Requires modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)
   - WebSocket connections may fail in some corporate networks
   - File drag-and-drop may not work in older browsers

3. **Security Considerations**
   - No file type validation beyond basic checks
   - Uploaded files stored temporarily without encryption
   - No rate limiting on file uploads

4. **Missing Features**
   - No user management interface
   - Limited export options
   - No batch processing
   - No analysis scheduling

### Known Bugs

1. **Analysis Progress**
   - Progress may not update in real-time for some analysis types
   - WebSocket disconnections may cause progress to freeze
   - Analysis status may not persist across page refreshes

2. **File Handling**
   - Some file types may not be recognized correctly
   - Large files may cause browser memory issues
   - File upload may fail silently in some cases

3. **Results Display**
   - Complex analysis results may not render properly
   - Export functionality may fail for large result sets
   - Charts and visualizations may not load correctly

## üîß Workarounds

### For Production Use

1. **Use CLI Interface**
   - The command-line interface is production-ready
   - Use `python reveng_analyzer.py` for reliable analysis
   - Web interface is for evaluation only

2. **File Size Limits**
   - Keep uploaded files under 50MB
   - Use CLI for larger files
   - Consider splitting large files

3. **Browser Issues**
   - Use Chrome or Firefox for best compatibility
   - Disable browser extensions that may interfere
   - Clear browser cache if experiencing issues

## üöÄ Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Stability (Q1 2025)
- Fix known bugs and performance issues
- Improve error handling and user feedback
- Add comprehensive testing
- Optimize for larger files

### Phase 2: Features (Q2 2025)
- Add user management interface
- Implement batch processing
- Add more export options
- Improve analysis progress tracking

### Phase 3: Production (Q3 2025)
- Security hardening
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment guides
- Monitoring and logging

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### For Developers

1. **Test with Small Files**
   - Start with files under 10MB
   - Test different file types (EXE, JAR, etc.)
   - Verify analysis results match CLI output

2. **Test Analysis Types**
   - Test each analysis module individually
   - Verify enhanced analysis features work
   - Check error handling for failed analyses

3. **Test Browser Compatibility**
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Test with different network conditions

### For Users

1. **Start Simple**
   - Use small test files first
   - Enable one analysis module at a time
   - Check results against CLI output

2. **Report Issues**
   - Use GitHub Issues to report bugs
   - Include browser and file information
   - Provide steps to reproduce
